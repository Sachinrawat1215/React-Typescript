These are my typescript notes which i created while watching frontend masters.. Hopes it will help you too.


**JSX.Element** - We can't use it with any JSX component in JSX contains more than one child JSX.

**JSX.Element[]** - We can use it with any JSX component in which JSX contains more than one child JSX but the issue with it is, It will throw error if we use directly string.

**React.ReactChildren** - Not at even an appropriate type; it's a utility function
